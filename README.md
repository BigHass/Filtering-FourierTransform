# Filtering-FourierTransform
Image Processing-Filtering using Fourier Transform by MATLAB 

## Notes
* Read a gray level image, and apply the ideal low pass filter & ideal high pass filter with cutoff value equal 30 using Fourier Transform.
* Read a gray level image, and apply the butterworth low pass filter & butterworth high pass filter with cutoff value equal 20 using Fourier Transform.
* Read a gray level image, and apply the gaussian low pass filter & gaussian high pass filter with cutoff value equal 10 using Fourier Transform.
